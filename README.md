# Introduction

# How to start

**Note** that this project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7 but in order to be able to take advantage of the complete functionality we **strongly recommend node >=v6.5.0 and npm >=3.10.3**.

**Here is how to [speed-up the build on Windows](https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed/wiki/Speed-up-the-build-on-Windows)**.

In order to start the seed use:

# to start deving with livereload site and coverage as well as continuous testing
npm run start.deving
