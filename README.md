# Introduction

# How to start

**Note** that this project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7 but in order to be able to take advantage of the complete functionality we **strongly recommend node >=v6.5.0 and npm >=3.10.3**.

In order to start the seed use:

# to start deving with livereload site and coverage as well as continuous testing
npm run start.deving

## TODO
 - Use images instead of toString for tiles in template (use Icons for Surfaces and Units)
 - Disallow a Road and a City on the same Tile
 - Allow 2 Settlers to work on the same Work at the same time quicker (reduce finishYear)
 - Fix hiding the dashboard with context actions for a Settler
 - Land units should be able to move more than one square per turn
 - Support Mountains

 - Introduce Food harvested per turn
 - Growth of a City

 - Introduce Hitpoints
